Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his company will be expanding its Shanghai factory and said Tesla was scaling production of a large, complex product faster than any manufacturer ever.
Musk covered a lot of ground during an 80-minute talk at the
Financial Times “Future of the Car” conference. Here are the main topics he discussed:
Faster Than Henry Ford
“Our growth rates are faster than any large manufacture production in the history of the earth,” said Musk “We’re faster than the Model T.”
Faster than the Model T is an impressive boast. But Tesla (ticker: TSLA) seems to be on track. Since Tesla started delivering the Model S in 2012 the company will deliver roughly 3.8 million vehicles, including expected 2022 delivers of about 1.4 million. Ford ’s Model T had cumulative sales of about 3.2 million units over the same span.

These days, manufacturing scale always comes up with Tesla (ticker: TSLA). Investors and analysts want to know how long the company can maintain 50%-plus unit growth rates into the future.
Fifty-percent is the company’s rough guide for investors. Deliveries have grown at about 65% a year on average for the past five years. Deliveries are expected to grow at about 56% in 2022.
China
“We will be expanding our Shanghai factory,” said Musk.
China is an important market for Tesla and every other auto maker. China is the world’s largest market for new cars and electric vehicles. Musk believes that China will account for 25% or 30% of Tesla’s total business in the long run.
China is also where he sees the stiffest EV competition coming from. “There’s a lot of super talented, hard working people in China,” added Musk. “They won’t be just burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3 a.m. oil.”
Self Driving Cars
“We are actually quite close to achieving self driving at a safety level that is better than human,” Musk said. “Best guess, we will get there this year.”
He’s said that before, of course. Even Tesla bulls are split on the company’s autonomous driving opportunity. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black attributes nothing for self-driving in his $1,600 price target for Tesla Stock. ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood believes Tesla’s full self-driving technology will be generating roughly $150 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, by the middle of this decade. That very bullish view underpins her very bullish $4,600 target price for Tesla. That is Wood’s target for 2026.

Manufacturing
“I’ve said many times prototypes are easy. Production is hard.”
Musk has said that many time, but he added a few interesting numbers. He says a car prototype takes 100 people and six months. To bring that prototype to production takes Tesla 10,000 people and, at least, 2 years.
Tesla stock closed up 1.6% at $800.04 a share. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3%.
