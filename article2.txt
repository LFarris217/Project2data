Shares of Tesla , which had risen earlier in the month before dipping, were back near late-August levels Thursday morning as analysts shared predictions regarding the electric-car makers third-quarter delivery and production numbers, expected next week.
Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA), down about 31% in 2019 through Wednesday’s close, was up 0.4% to $229.60 Thursday morning. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.7%.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has a Neutral rating and a $220 price target on the shares—below FactSet’s $268 average—said Thursday that a range of 88,000 to 90,000 deliveries is likely.
Wall Street’s consensus is 98,000. “All eyes on the Street will be focused on whether the company can deliver enough vehicles over the goal line in the coming days to hit the Street’s target range for 95,000 to 100,000 units, which in our opinion is an unlikely event,” Ives wrote.
Quarterly deliveries are a useful, if incomplete, preview of Tesla’s quarterly results. (The company recognizes revenue when a customer takes delivery of a vehicle.) When they are finally reported, delivery numbers usually rise somewhat—but because the numbers are generally close, and the company typically details deliveries by model type, some guesses around auto revenue and gross margin can be made.
More broadly, Tesla has stuck to full-year guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 deliveries, with Wall Street currently looking for 358,000. The third-quarter number will illustrate just how far the company needs to go to get there.
Among other recent analyst comments on deliveries:
• Dan Levy at Credit Suisse, a Tesla bear, expects 84,000 deliveries, though he acknowledged “potential upside” in a Thursday note.
“Even if it meets consensus on deliveries, the question into third-quarter earnings per share will be around margins and how the stock reacts with likely the first negative year-over-year revenue growth quarter since 2012,” he wrote.
• Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets, also a bear, boosted his forecast on Wednesday from 86,300 to 97,200. He also lowered his quarterly estimate of per-share losses to 49 cents from 91 cents.
The quarter “likely came in better than we initially modeled helped by stronger Europe,” he wrote.
• Baird’s Ben Kallo, a Tesla bull, wrote Thursday that he expects 96,000 deliveries. “We think [the] shares will react positively if the company achieves 95,000-plus deliveries,” he wrote.
Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research, the Street’s biggest Tesla bull, said Wednesday he sees upside to the delivery consensus.
“We expect Tesla to give bullish commentary on demand,” he wrote. The “latest data points show the Model 3 is dominating in Europe (…while demand in North American and China remain strong, too.)”
